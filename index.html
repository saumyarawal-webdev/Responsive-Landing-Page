          Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
          education system, which falls under the command of the government at
          three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the
          Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
          Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
          fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
          the total number of public schools to private schools in India is 10:3
